        <p><strong>Familiar</strong> (“I”, “my”, or “me”) operates the Familiar mobile application (the “App”), which is available on both iOS and Android platforms.</p>

        <h2 class="mt-4">Information Collection and Use</h2>
        <p>I do not collect or store any personal information from users of the App.</p>

        <h2 class="mt-4">Firebase Crashlytics and Analytics</h2>
        <p>The App uses Firebase Crashlytics and Firebase Analytics, services provided by Google, to collect and analyze crash reports and usage data. These services help me improve the App by providing insights into how the App is being used and identifying any issues that may arise. The data collected by these services is anonymized and does not include any personal information. For more information on how Firebase handles data, please refer to the <a href="https://firebase.google.com/support/privacy">Firebase Privacy and Security page</a>.</p>

        <h2 class="mt-4">Google AdMob</h2>
        <p>The App uses Google AdMob to serve advertisements. AdMob may use cookies and other technologies to collect information about your device and usage patterns in order to serve targeted ads. This data is shared with Google and its partners to deliver personalized ads. For more information on how AdMob collects and uses data, please refer to the <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy">Google Privacy Policy</a>.</p>

        <h2 class="mt-4">Feedback Form</h2>
        <p>The App includes an external link to a Google Form that allows users to leave feedback. I do not collect any personal information through this form. Users are advised not to leave any private information in their feedback. The form does not record users’ email addresses or any other personal information.</p>

        <h2 class="mt-4">Data Security</h2>
        <p>I value your trust in using my App, thus I strive to use commercially acceptable means of protecting it. However, remember that no method of transmission over the internet, or method of electronic storage is 100% secure and reliable, and I cannot guarantee its absolute security.</p>

        <h2 class="mt-4">Children’s Privacy</h2>
        <p>The App does not address anyone under the age of 13. I do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under 13. In the case I discover that a child under 13 has provided me with personal information, I will immediately delete it. If you are a parent or guardian and you are aware that your child has provided me with personal information, please contact me so that I can take the necessary actions.</p>

        <h2 class="mt-4">Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p>I may update my Privacy Policy from time to time. Thus, you are advised to review this page periodically for any changes. I will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page. These changes are effective immediately after they are posted on this page.</p>

        <h2 class="mt-4">Contact Me</h2>
        <p>If you have any questions or suggestions about my Privacy Policy, please contact me via one of the following feedback forms:</p>
